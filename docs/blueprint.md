- Background color: Light grey (#F0F4F8), providing a neutral, non-distracting backdrop for important information.
- Accent color: Soft green (#34A853) to highlight important actions and confirmations, offering a sense of resolution and security.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text
- Use clear, minimalist icons for navigation and actions, focusing on recognizability and ease of use. The icons should support the sense of safety, security, and trust.
- Employ a clean, linear layout to guide the user through the process, ensuring that the interface is easy to follow. Maintain generous spacing and clear divisions between sections to reduce visual clutter.
- Incorporate subtle transitions to indicate progress, providing gentle feedback to the user. These animations should enhance usability and clearly signal actions such as the transition from audio input to formal report.
